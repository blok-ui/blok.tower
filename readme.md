Blok Tower
==========

Web applications for Haxe.

Getting Started
---------------

> Note: This is very much a work in progress! Nothing really works yet: it can only generate a static, non-interactive site. The infrastructure is in place for hydration and client-side routing, but the required compile steps are not in yet.
>
> In the near future, Tower will include a built-in server (mainly for development) as an additional target, but it will always be geared towards static sites.
